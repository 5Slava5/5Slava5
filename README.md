  Hello, my name is Viacheslav Shapoval , and I have a positive view of the surrounding world and believe that life is given to recognize and feel all around, to gain experience, to improve, to create new, interesting and useful for others. I have some life experience in various areas, personnel management in a large retail network, production activities. On every page I tried to be useful to my loved ones and get pleasure from it. Some I’m good at, some I’m not. In order to create something – you always need the necessary tool. Having already mastered many different tools, physical and mental, I decided to be more useful and find something new and interesting for myself. 
  Gaining experience and knowledge in the IT industry, I master new tools - Backend #Python, various libraries and frameworks. I also have small educational projects (using different Python features) which can be found on my page in GitHub. I constantly get new knowledge and experience from different offline courses and books.
  In solving various tasks related to personnel management or the movement and accounting of goods, I was happy to use Microsoft Office, especially Excel with wide possibilities of accounting, analysis and use of data, which pushed me to study deeper and more useful programming possibilities. The deeper I use and learn programming capabilities, the more I enjoy the opportunity to improve my products and their functionality. I understand that I want to develop my knowledge and capabilities in the field of computer technology and programming. For the sake of gaining valuable experience, I will gladly take part in your project with your team and try to be useful.
  Summing up everything, I want to emphasize that in my life, I have changed my activity several times fundamentally depending on circumstances, life requirements, and the desire to improve the life of those who were next to me. It was certainly difficult, but this way I gained more valuable life experience in communicating with people, in production, and in the use of various tools. I am also very important to improve the strengths of my personality, such as responsibility, methodology, thoroughness, toughness. I believe that the systematic thinking, vision of relationships, independence and at the same time ability to work in the team can build an additional argument of work in the field of computer technologies.
  I am sure that it is time to change its present one again, using the new tool – Python and other products, which will be useful to people.

  Regards,
  Viacheslav Shapoval
